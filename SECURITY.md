# Security & Privacy

Discov occupies a central role in your workflow — it sees your keystrokes, clipboard, and AI prompts. This document explains exactly what the app monitors and what data leaves your device.

## Data Collected & Telemetry

**Discov collects no analytics.** There is no telemetry SDK in the app: upstream
SuperCmd shipped an [Aptabase](https://aptabase.com/) `app_started` event, and
that integration was removed in this fork along with its dependency.

The only outbound reporting left is extension install/uninstall counts, covered
below.

### Extension Install/Uninstall Reporting

When you install or uninstall an extension, the following is sent to `https://api.supercmd.sh`:

- Extension name (e.g. `raycast/github`)
- An **anonymous machine ID** — a randomly generated hex string stored at `~/Library/Application Support/Discov/.machine-id`

This is used for install/download count metrics on the extension catalog.

## What Leaves Your Device

| Destination | What is sent | When | Controlled by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `https://api.supercmd.sh` | Extension name + anonymous machine ID | On extension install/uninstall | Extension store usage |
| `https://api.supercmd.sh` | Extension name | When browsing the extension catalog | Extension store usage |
| Your configured AI provider (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / custom) | Your prompt + system prompt | When you use AI features | AI settings |
| `http://localhost:11434` | Your prompt | When using Ollama | AI settings (local) |
| `https://api.supermemory.ai` | Memory snippets (up to ~2,400 chars) | When Supermemory integration is enabled | Memory settings |
| GitHub Releases API | App version string | On auto-update check | Built-in updater |
| Extension CDN / S3 | Binary download | On extension install | Extension store usage |

## Privacy Options

### Analytics

Nothing to disable — analytics were removed from this fork. The
`@aptabase/electron` dependency is gone, so no build-time or runtime opt-out is
needed.

### Disable Extension Install Reporting

To opt out of install/uninstall reporting:

1. Delete `~/Library/Application Support/Discov/.machine-id` to discard the current anonymous ID.
2. Build from source and remove the `reportInstall()` / `reportUninstall()` calls in `src/main/extension-api.ts`.

### Disable Clipboard History

Go to **Settings → General** and disable **Clipboard History**, or delete the stored history:
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Discov/clipboard-history/
```

### Use Local AI

Set your AI provider to **Ollama** with a local model. All AI processing stays on-device.

### Use Local Memory

Leave `supermemoryApiKey` blank. Discov will fall back to `local-memories.json` on your device.

## API Key & Secret Storage

API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Supermemory) are stored in **plain text** in:

```
~/Library/Application Support/Discov/settings.json
```

- The file is readable by your user account and any process running as you.
- macOS Time Machine backups will include this file.
- Any extension running inside Discov can request a file read via IPC.

**Mitigations until keychain storage is implemented:**
- Keep your device screen locked when unattended.
- Exclude `~/Library/Application Support/Discov/` from Time Machine if you're concerned about backup exposure.
- Use read-only API keys with minimal permissions where your provider allows it.

> Using the OS keychain for secret storage is on our roadmap.

---

## Extension Security

Extensions run as JavaScript bundles inside the renderer process, with access to Discov's IPC bridge. An extension can:

- Read and write files on your behalf
- Execute AppleScript
- Make network requests
- Read settings (including other extensions' preferences)

**Mitigations:**
- Extensions in the Discov store are sourced from the public [Raycast extension registry](https://github.com/raycast/extensions), which is open-source and community-reviewed.
- Extension bundles are pre-built with esbuild — no `eval()` or dynamic code generation at runtime.
- `contextIsolation: true` and `nodeIntegration: false` are enforced on all windows.

Treat installing an extension like installing any other macOS app — it runs with your user's permissions.

**Per-extension sandboxing (capability restrictions) is not yet implemented.**

## Electron Security Architecture

| Control | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `contextIsolation: true` | ✅ Enabled on all windows | Renderer cannot access Node.js directly |
| `nodeIntegration: false` | ✅ Enabled on all windows | Node APIs not exposed to renderer |
| `contextBridge` preload | ✅ Used correctly | Only explicit IPC surface is exposed |
| `sandbox: true` | ⚠️ Partial | Enabled on overlay windows; not on main windows |
| Content Security Policy | ⚠️ Not enforced | `sc-asset://` protocol has `bypassCSP: true` for extension assets |
| IPC sender validation | ⚠️ Not implemented | Relies on Electron's isolation boundary |
| Hardened Runtime | ✅ Enabled | macOS notarization with hardened runtime |
| HTTPS for all remote calls | ✅ | All external endpoints use TLS; Ollama is localhost |

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No telemetry opt-out UI** — must block at the network level or build from source.
2. **API keys stored in plain text** — not using macOS Keychain yet.
3. **No per-extension sandboxing** — all extensions share the same IPC surface.
4. **IPC handlers lack sender validation** — relies on Electron's process isolation.
5. **CSP bypass for asset protocol** — `sc-asset://` bypasses Content Security Policy to serve extension images.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, **please do not open a public GitHub issue.**

Report privately via:
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: [https://github.com/tadeucbm/Discov/security/advisories/new](https://github.com/tadeucbm/Discov/security/advisories/new)

<!-- TODO(rebrand): add a security contact address once a Discov domain exists. -->


Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any proof-of-concept code (if applicable)

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide a fix timeline within 7 days for critical issues.
